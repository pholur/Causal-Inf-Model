<h3>Logic and Proofs Diagnostic Test</h3>

<form method="post" action="mailto:pholur@g.ucla.edu?subject=Module1" enctype="text/plain">

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>: [v0.1] This is a diagnostic test to find weaknesses in your logic to solve and complete proofs in engineering. </br></br>
<b>NOTE</b>: EXACTLY 1 option is correct for ALL questions. Please answer carefully and fast. </br>This application takes into account the time taken to answer the total questions on a page as a feature to determine your "smarts" ;)</br>
The quiz should take ~20 minutes to solve on average. You cannot go to a pervious page.

<P>1. Which of the following is equivalent to A <=> B?<BR>
<input type="radio" name="1a">A => B and !A => !B<BR>
<input type="radio" name="1b">A => B and !B => A<BR>
<input type="radio" name="1c">A => B and B<BR>
<input type="radio" name="1d">B => A and A<BR>
<input type="radio" name="1e">B => A and A => B<BR>
</p>

<P>2. How do you find a tight upper bound for a scalar variable x?<BR>
<input type="radio" name="2a">Show that x <= L for a constant L<BR>
<input type="radio" name="2b">Show that x <= L and x == L for a specific case<BR>
<input type="radio" name="2c">Show that x <= L and x CANNOT be > L<BR>
<input type="radio" name="2d">Show that x == L for specific L and x CANNOT be > L for any L<BR>
<input type="radio" name="2e">None<BR>
</p>

<P>3. Which of the following is an example of the Central Limit Theorem?<BR>
<input type="radio" name="3a">The PDF of the number on a die rolled infinitely many times is uniform.<BR>
<input type="radio" name="3b">The PDF of the sum of the number rolled on a die infinitely many times is Gaussian.<BR>
<input type="radio" name="3c">The sum of a finite number of Gaussian PDFs is Gaussian.<BR>
<input type="radio" name="3d">The central limit theorem is not a description on the PDF of a test.<BR>
<input type="radio" name="3e">None<BR>

<input type="radio" name="4e">None of these are wrong.<BR>
</p>

<P>5. Which of the following equivalences are wrong?<BR>
