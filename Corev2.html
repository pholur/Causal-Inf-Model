<h3>Logic and Proofs Diagnostic Test @ UCLA ECE Dept.</h3>

<form method="post" action="/Core.html/r">

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>: [v1.0] This is a diagnostic test to find weaknesses in your logic to solve and complete proofs in engineering. You can ONLY take it ONCE during a 1hr period (backend check)</br></br>
<b>NOTE</b>: More than 1 option may be correct for any question. Please answer carefully and fast. </br>This application takes into account the time taken to answer the total questions on a page as a feature to determine your "smarts" ;)</br>
The quiz should take ~20 minutes to solve on average. You cannot go to a previous page.
